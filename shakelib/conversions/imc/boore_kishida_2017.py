    This class implements the Boore and Kishida (2017) conversions for
    horizontal intensity measure components. 

    This class explicitly supports the following subset of the conversions
    provided by B&K (specified as OpenQuake IMCs):
        
        - RotD50 <=> GMRotI50
        - RotD50 <=> AVERAGE_HORIZONTAL (i.e., Geometric Mean "as recorded")
        - RotD100 <=> RotD50
        - RotD50 <=> GREATER_OF_TWO_HORIZONTAL
        - RotD100 <=> GREATER_OF_TWO_HORIZONTAL
        - GMRotI50 <=> GREATER_OF_TWO_HORIZONTAL
        - AVERAGE_HORIZONTAL <=> GREATER_OF_TWO_HORIZONTAL

    Not supported are IMCs for which there is no OpenQuake equivalent; 
    also not supported are chained conversions (that is, we do not 
    support conversions from A to C when conversions from A to B and 
    B to C are available; these must be done in two steps. For IMCs 
    not explicitly
    supported by B&K, we assume the IMC is equivalent to the geometric
    mean (which B&K call GM_AR), based on our reading of
    Beyer & Bommer (2006).
